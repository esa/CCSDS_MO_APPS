/**
This package contains a simple demonstration application of a service consumer. The consumer displays updates from the
provider on a simple grid and allows the registration for updates using either a wildcard or explicitly naming the
parameters. It also has menu items for the invocation of some simple operations supported by the provider to test basic
interaction pattern handling of the transport which is useful for testing a new transport or encoding.
